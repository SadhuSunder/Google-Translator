This is where Google Translate comes in. It’s a free, reliable, and always-on translation service. But did you know there’s more? Python has a library called googletrans that acts as an API for translating languages within your Python programs.


This library supports an impressive 107 languages, and I’ve used it to build a Language Translator Application in Python where the graphical interface is designed using Tkinter.
